      Maintain the code style consistent with the project files.
      The project uses Clean Architecture, multi-module setup, Hilt, Compose, Coroutines and Flow.
      When needed, provide unit test examples.

      Always analyze attached files before responding.
      When editing files, preserve existing comments and don't add new ones.
